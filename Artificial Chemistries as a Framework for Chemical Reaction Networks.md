Over the summer, I spent  time designing and simulating artificial chemistries. To describe artificial chemistries, they are componential systems that are used to simulate chemical-like reactions. 
This is defined by rules for reactions and assembly that aim to understand the fundamental rules and behavior of chemical systems. The chemical reactions that are modeled in Stochastic_Rxn  are transforming into products that help demonstrate simple reaction rules that can produce complex behaviors. The applications of ordinary differential equations will be used for the application of a Lotka-Volterra predator-prey model.

The Stochastic_Rxn graph shows the concentration of species changing over time, and displays the implications of reaction rules for a chemical mixture. 
The Lotka-Volterra predator-prey model graph  shows the different applications of the grass and the prey species. This reveals how the species interactions can be expressed as a chemical reaction network producing these oscillating population dynamics through the systems of differential equations.

Future directions for the application of artificial chemistries 
help build the understanding of chemical systems to build on the fundamentals of the behaviors that may lead to future applications of Chemical Reaction Networks(CRNs) and DNA Strand displacement, which is a molecular mechanism that is capable of implementing CRNs. 
Enabling biochemical reactions to be modeled using the DNA-based Boolean logic gates towards more future applications for the detection of cancer-specific protein signals biomarkers.
